# What Can Be Done Better?
- Removing the requirements for contributing to the repo unless it is needed.
- Asking for more help to do the following
  - Seeking for Sponsors - To follow up and get the sponsorship perks 
  - Asking volunteers to organise the meetup - To help in finding venues and speakers who would like to speak in the PyJobRaft
  - Ordering of food - To organise and streamline the reimbursement aspects for ordering of PyJobRaft
- Changing the PyJobRaft to purely to just a monthly networking event for paid members only with a max of 20 pax/session
- Update the community guidelines regarding on info. By keeping whatever that was discussed or talked in the session as **secret** and not **spread** any info around unless consent is given by the individiual.
- Keep a list of restaurant/venues for x ppl but still keep to 80% non-hala and 20% vegan (including without **egg**). If we plan to sponsor food as the community.

# ToDo
- Ask the community leaders on starting with PyJobRaft with only our paid members
- Create a **food reimbursement form** with invoice attachment on the event date and amount paid for food or expesnes related to the event
- Look at what we could add value for our paid members besides just the **PyJobRaft** networking event.
