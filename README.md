# What is PyJobRaft?
PyJobRaft is a job search support group for tech workers who are currently searching for a job in tech. We help them in gaining clarity and receive support from their peers or experienced tech advisors in their career journey in tech.

I choose PyJobRaft because **raft** refers to a group of ottters (we love otters in SG) resting together.
